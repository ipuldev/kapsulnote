# Kapsulnote

Kapsulnote is a dynamic, open-source platform that empowers users to share and send text content anonymously, without the need for a login. Similar to a more private Twitter, it fosters free speech and open dialogue in a secure environment. With built-in toxicity detection, Kapsulnote ensures conversations remain respectful and constructive.

## Features

- **Anonymous Text Sharing**: Effortlessly share and send text content without creating an account or logging in.
- **Free Speech Promotion**: Express yourself freely while enjoying a supportive and respectful community.
- **Toxicity Detection**: Advanced algorithms help maintain a positive atmosphere by detecting and flagging toxic content.
